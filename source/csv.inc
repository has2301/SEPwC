CSV files
------------

CSV files are text files. They contain data in text format, with columns seperated by a delimiter
and rows seperated by a new line.

The delimaiter is often a comma ',', hence CSV (Comma Seperated Values). Other common delimiters
are whitespace, :kbd:Tab, or pipe symbols :kbd:|
