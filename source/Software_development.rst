Software development
====================

Software developmen (softdev) or engineering (softeng) are the process by which we write code. There is a subtle difference between these two titles, 
with engineers being resonsible for creating, designing, and testing the whole software applicaiton, whereas developers are responsible for a 
portion of that cycle. When we write code for ourselve, we are software engineers!

There are multiple processes by which software is created. Here, we're not going to become softdevs or softengs in any meaningful way
but we are going to learn some of the basics of the process, which helps us write better code.

Revision control
----------------

We've already learnt one of the key tools (or if you've skipped to this bit, you can go back and learn about it), which is revision control.
Rather than keep seperate versions of code in seperate files (which would be a nightmare for any reasonable sized applicaiton), we keep versions
of files in a revision control system. In this course we've learnt about `git`.


Testing
--------

How do you know your code is correct? See this chapter!


Development process
--------------------

SOftware development goes through a number of stages:

 - requirements capture; what should it do?
 - writing code
 - testing
 - bug fixes
 - client testing/approval

When writing code for yourself you are both the developer and the client. If you write code for someone else, then these roles are split.
