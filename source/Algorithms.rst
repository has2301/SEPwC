Thinking like a computer
========================

To write code, we have to think in terms of algorithms and logic flow. We have covered the basics of code structures above, so now
we can arrange those to form algorithms and then into programs. We can think about this in terms of psuedo-code (like I wrote above).
Remember, psuedo-code is not a formal language but is code written to be read by a human with no concerns about syntax. We can also 
depict code as a flow diagram. 

Let's build software to do some simple tasks.
