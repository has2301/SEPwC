Thinking like a computer
========================

To write code, we have to think in terms of algorithms and logic flow. We have covered the basics of code structures above, so now
we can arrange those to form algorithms and then into programs. We can think about this in terms of psuedo-code (like I wrote above).
Remember, psuedo-code is not a formal language but is code written to be read by a human with no concerns about syntax. We can also 
depict code as a flow diagram; this is more useful as we build more complex algorithms. 

Let's build software to do some simple tasks.


Making a jam sandwich
---------------------

Write down the steps to make a jam sandwich. Create a flow diagram of the list


.. hint::
 
   Make sure you are very precise in your desciptions


Plotting a graph with options
-----------------------------

Write down the psuedo-code needed to read in the data below
and plot a graph of time (x axis) vs wave height (y axis).
Allow the user to flip the graph (so wave height vs time).


Create a word cloud
-------------------

Write down the psuedo-code and/or create a flow diagram
to to create a word cloud of some text file only including
words that occur more than 10 times *and* does not include
the words "and", "the", "or".
